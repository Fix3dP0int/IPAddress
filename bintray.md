**[Latest Version 5.3.2](https://github.com/seancfoley/IPAddress/releases/tag/v5.3.2)** 

Requires Java 8 or higher.  Compatible with Android using Android API level 24 or higher.  The code is compiled with Java 8 but provides a Java 9 compiled module-info.class file for those using the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).  You may need (or wish) to [delete the module-info](https://github.com/seancfoley/IPAddress/issues/16#issuecomment-452425235), which can be done [with gradle](https://github.com/seancfoley/IPAddress/issues/16#issuecomment-452564690), when using Android, other Java 8 environments, or Java version 9 and up [environments](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/random-resourceconfig-instance-does-not-contain-any-root-resource-classes-exceptions-in-jira-7-and-some-early-jira-8-versions/33897) that do not [properly support modules](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AMPS-1509). Since Android Studio 3.3, deleting the module-info is no longer necessary.
